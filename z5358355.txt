Week 1
Formed group. Name is 3900W18BHighFive. Scrum master is Lucy. Scrum master set up Jira. Confirmed joined Jira.
Decided weekly meeting and standup schedule. In the weekly meeting, we decided on the project. Chose P13.
Informed mentors of project selection.

Week 2
Started proposal. In lab, allocated parts for proposal. I am in charge of 3a, which is the storyboards.
Will wait for user stories to be added to work on my part and will add user stories as well.
Further detail will be discussed in the meeting arranged outside of lab.

Week 3
Worked together with Offa on the storyboards. Contributed some user stories for user registration, metrics visualisation and
profile personalisation. I started off the storyboards for user registration and profile personalisation,
and then Offa extended on these and completed them to higher quality, then I worked mainly on the metrics visualisation.
I discussed with the team about approaches for presenting the metrics. Upon near completion of the storyboards, went through with
the team to address any concerns about the storyboards and made changes as needed. Once completed, the storyboards were added to
the proposal for submission. I helped to check formatting of the proposal.

Week 4
Discussed with Offa about functions needed for user registration by looking at the user stories and outlined some details,
e.g. factors for password strength, what happens when an account gets blocked (we decided that the user would need to recover their account).
Then we allocated tasks. I was in charge of login, logout and blocking the account after multiple login attempt failures.
Mostly worked on the logic of it while waiting for setup of the database to store user data.
Once the database is setup, would begin in earnest with functionality and making the routes for the server.
Also intend to set up the server using Python Flask.

Week 5
Worked on implementing user login functionality. Discussed with team about demo and presented demo in lab.
Worked on Retrospective A with the team.
Aiming to finish off rest of unfinished user registration functionality as soon as possible. Then will discuss
with Offa about framework and metric selection and discuss with Ruoxi as needed about database-related matters
for implementation.

Week 6
Ruoxi provided a script which populates the database with data so I took some time to look through the tables
and understand what each table contains.
Lucy pointed out some bugs to do with login functionality and also suggested adding an error message for missing
fields, so I worked on that. A bug was also found for the block account functionality but that will be placed at
lower priority to complete for now.
Main focus will be to discuss with Offa what needs to be done for metrics selection. I wrote down some tasks we may
need to do in order to achieve the functionality for metrics selection and will discuss with Offa and refine to proceed.
